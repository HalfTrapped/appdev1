## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because I know they are essential tools for developers. With Git, I can keep track of my code changes and work more efficiently, while GitHub will allow me to collaborate with my classmates and showcase my projects online. Learning these tools will prepare me for real-world software development.
