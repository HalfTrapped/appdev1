      <h1>Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub</h1>
      <p>
        I want to learn Git and GitHub because it's necessary tool if I want to succeed and work as a part of developer team by being an SQA, PM, etc. If I can learn how to do git commands and navigate Github like its the back of hand then I would be a good asset to the company.
