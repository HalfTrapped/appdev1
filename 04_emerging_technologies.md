# Emerging Technologies

## Machine Learning

# Purpose
    
* Machine learning is used as learning and training tools that utilizes self-improving deep learning algorithms that process big data, patterns, and relations between variables. Both are used in IT industries and education due to their adaptable nature to learn from thousands of data to either categorize data or suggest things for the user.

# Usage

* Education

    * gOne use of machine learning in education is the use of AI tutor and chatbot. Natural language processing powered tutors and chatbots are used to find learning contents, engage students with activities and quizzes and providing as a personal tutor you can contact anytime. Another is adaptive learning. ML-based predictive data is gathered and analyzwed to adjust learning to the preference of the user.

* IT Industry

    * Machine learning is used in cyber security by using an algorithm to analyze network traffic and detect malware and other malicious acitivities in devices. Another use is the to model typical user behavior to see unusual behavior from the usual patterns observed.  

### examples: 

* Education

    * Osmo is an app that uses a unique way to educate. It combines digital activities and physical game pieces that are identified by the computer through a camera. Through interactive, gamified learning, it makes engaging content for children to learn various subjects like coding, math, spelling, and drawing.

    * Course Hero is a e-learning platform that uses Amazon's machine learning services. It can detect spam and copyright infringements uploads by using smart content search and a machine-learning based fraud detection to supervise said uploads.

* IT Industry

    * Google's Gmail uses machine learning algorithm to automatically filter user emails into Primary, Social, Promotions, and Spam folders. Another one is the through the use of ML in email management tools like Levity where it uses ML to categorize emails using text classification algorithms. This makes for a personalized responses based on the catergory to save time.
